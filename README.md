Social Media Monitor
====================

An app to play with event streams, socket.io, and nio.js.

This takes data streamed about social media accounts and displays it in the browser. Data is updated every second.

## Getting Started

Install the bower components:
`npm install bower -g` (if you haven't already)
`bower install`

Open `index.html` in the browser. I like `http-server` to serve it up on localhost:8080!

See data.
